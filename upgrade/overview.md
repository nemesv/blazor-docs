# How to Upgrade Telerik UI for Blazor

This article explains how to upgrade to a new version of Telerik UI for Blazor.

To upgrade the Telerik components, you need to update their NuGet package reference, and, if you use them, the CDN links.

>tip Before starting an upgrade of your project, you may find it useful to review the following information:
>
> * [UI for Blazor Release History](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/release-history) â€” reviewing the release notes for all releases you go through will let you see what has changed, what fixes, features and components have been implemented so you are better prepared to meet your project's challenges.
> * Whether you are affected by a breaking change. The [List of Telerik UI for Blazor Versions with Breaking Changes]({%slug versions-with-breaking-changes%}) article shows which releases of our component suite have breaking changes. Review the information for the releases you go through so you can evaluate whether you will be affected by anything.

## Upgrade Process

To upgrade the Telerik UI for Blazor components used in your project, perform the following steps:

1. @[template](/_contentTemplates/common/general-info.md#ensure-nuget-packge-for-upgrade)

1. Update the version of the `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor` package your project references. If you are using a trial version, the package name is `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor.Trial`.

1. If you are using our CDN for the JS Interop file, update the version in its URL. It must match the version of the package itself. For example, if you are upgrading to the `2.0.0` version, the CDN link must be:

    **HTML**
    
        <script src="https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/blazor/2.0.0/telerik-blazor.min.js" defer></script>
        
    Generally, the URL has the following format:
    
    **HTML**
    
        <script src="https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/blazor/<VERSION NUMBER>/telerik-blazor.min.js" defer></script>

## Upgrade from Trial to Commercial

If you have just purchased a license and you need to migrate from the trial package to the licensed version, perform the following steps:

1. @[template](/_contentTemplates/common/general-info.md#ensure-nuget-packge-for-upgrade)

1. Replace the reference to the `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor.Trial` package in your project with a reference to the `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor` package.

1. If you are using static assets for our JS Interop file, update its path to match the package name:

    **HTML**
    
        <!-- FROM
        <script src="_content/telerik.ui.for.blazor.trial/js/telerik-blazor.js" defer></script>
        
        TO
        -->
        <script src="_content/telerik.ui.for.blazor/js/telerik-blazor.js" defer></script>

## Troubleshooting

The most common problem you will encounter when upgrading is wrong references to our JS Interop file. You can read more about fixing them in the [Troubleshoot JavaScript Errors]({%slug troubleshooting-js-errors%}) article.
